## Installation and Usage

No installation needed. Just open the HTML file and start annotating.
You will have to manage data yourself, so this is best for small annotation workloads, design iteration, or as a foundation for more complex tools.

## Goals

- Backend for data management
- Backend for AI tools.
- Better UI
